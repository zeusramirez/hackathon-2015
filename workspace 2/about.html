  <h1>About Our Game</h1>
  <p>Our game is called Pitch It! . At first, we had many ideas from music trivia to karaoke but in the end we chose the option that would be both a challenge for our team to create and enjoyable for the user. </p>
  <p>The concept of our game is to use your voice to control Junior the Note so he can avoid the obstacles on his path. Colliding with a block results in losing and game resets</p>
